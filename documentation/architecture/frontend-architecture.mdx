# Frontend and Static Assets Architecture

This section describes how the frontend static assets are managed, embedded, and served within the todo web server application. It explains the architecture used to bundle client-side assets, expose them over HTTP, and integrate them with the Go backend, enabling seamless static file delivery optimized for deployment.

## Overview

The frontend assets (JavaScript, CSS, images, fonts, and other static files) are a crucial part of the web server, enabling UI presentation and interactivity. This application uses Go 1.16's `embed` package to compile static assets directly into the executable binary. This approach eliminates the need for external static file servers or runtime file dependencies, making deployment simpler and more robust.

The embedded assets correspond to the frontend build output located in the `/dist` directory, which typically contains the processed TailwindCSS, HTMX-enhanced HTML templates, client JS files, and other necessary resources.

Serving these assets efficiently is achieved by mounting a dedicated HTTP route (`/dist/*`) that delivers these files on requests.

---

## Static Assets Embedding

Go's `embed` package facilitates embedding files or directories at compile-time. The application defines an embedded filesystem variable to include all files from the `dist` directory:

```go
package assets

import (
  "embed"
)

// Assets embeds all files in internal/assets/dist
//go:embed dist/*
var Assets embed.FS
```

- This declaration bundles the entire `dist` directory contents.
- `Assets` is an `embed.FS` filesystem compliant with Go's `fs.FS` API, allowing access to asset files.

---

## Serving Embedded Assets

A function mounts the embedded filesystem onto the HTTP router using `http.FileServer` wrapped by `http.FS`:

```go
package assets

import (
  "net/http"
  "github.com/go-chi/chi/v5"
)

// Mount attaches the /dist route serving embedded static files
func Mount(r chi.Router) {
  fs := http.FS(Assets)
  fileServer := http.FileServer(fs)

  r.Route("/dist", func(r chi.Router) {
    r.Get("/*", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
      fileServer.ServeHTTP(w, r)
    })
  })
}
```

- This sets up the `GET /dist/*` route to serve all embedded static files.
- Using `http.FileServer` ensures proper handling of content types, byte ranges, caching headers, and directory indexes.

---

## Integration with HTTP Router

- The application uses the [chi router](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) for routing HTTP requests.
- The `assets.Mount()` function is called during server startup to integrate these static asset routes into the main route tree.

The relevant integration occurs in `cmd/server/main.go`:

```go
router := chi.NewRouter()

// Mount the static assets handler
assets.Mount(router)
```

This setup ensures that all requests to `/dist/*` are handled by the embedded asset server.

---

## Example: Embedding and Mounting Assets

Here's a minimal example demonstrating embedding assets and mounting them to a `chi` router:

```go
package main

import (
  "embed"
  "net/http"
  "github.com/go-chi/chi/v5"
)

//go:embed dist/*
var assets embed.FS

func main() {
  r := chi.NewRouter()

  fs := http.FS(assets)
  fileServer := http.FileServer(fs)

  r.Route("/dist", func(r chi.Router) {
    r.Get("/*", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
      fileServer.ServeHTTP(w, r)
    })
  })

  http.ListenAndServe(":3000", r)
}
```

- This example compiles `dist` directory assets and serves them on `/dist/*`.
- The server listens on port 3000 and supports all static asset requests.

```

- Frontend assets built externally are embedded into Go binary.
- The embedded filesystem is mounted on `/dist` route.
- HTTP requests for `/dist/*` are routed via chi and served from embedded assets.

---

## Integration Details and Dependencies

### Dependencies

- **Go 1.16+**: Required for native `embed` package support.
- **`github.com/go-chi/chi`**: Router used to mount handlers and route requests.
- **`net/http`**: Standard library package to serve static files.

### System Touchpoints

- **Frontend build system** outputs compiled static resources into `/dist`.
- **Embedding step** includes `/dist` contents via `//go:embed` directive.
- **Router setup** mounts embedded assets on `/dist/*` path.
- **HTTP server** listens for requests, dispatching static asset requests to embedded file server.

### Responsibilities

- Keep static asset files in sync with embedded assets directory.
- Ensure HTTP routes for static content are properly mounted early in the server lifecycle.
- Manage caching and content negotiation through HTTP server configurations or middleware (extension point).

This architecture allows the todo web server to be self-contained, with frontend assets tightly integrated into the backend binary for ease of deployment and reliable static resource delivery.
